You'll see included in the folders are black and white variants, the idea is if you'd like any color besides black you're more than free to create your own!

To do so, you simply click the mesh itself (under hips in the drop down), unlock the shader if it's not already, and click and drag ONLY the Albedo/Color texture into the texture slot of the shader. 

To the right of 'Texture' theres a color box. Vuala! Any color you'd like. 

If you need more customizability, Substance Painter files are available in your Gumroad library.
